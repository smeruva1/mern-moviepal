# moviePal - enrich your movie list wisely

## Overview

During this time of quarantine.... we created an App to help ease our daily stress of picking a perfect Movie. We understand there are many movie rating apps, but our's stand out solely based on the credibility of family and friends. moviePal, is a movie app which allows you to search for Movies, maintain a single watchlist, rate Movies, show real time availability at streaming services and most importantly rating by your family and friends.


## Technologies

* react hooks
* react-bootstrap
* Node.js
* Express
* Mongo
* mongoose
* axios
* bcrypt
* jsonwebtoken
* react Navbar
* react-router-dom
* Heroku
* themoviedb API
* utelly API



## Challenges

we started with a OMDB API, which gave us limited information and after the app was ready started to integrate jsonwebtoken. 
5 days to deadline, we had to drop the repo and created a new repo to first get User/Login info working with jsonwebtoken before adding Movie info.
